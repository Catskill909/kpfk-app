# 🎨 iOS Lockscreen Artwork Fix - Complete

## ✅ Status: IMPLEMENTED & READY FOR TESTING

## 📋 Quick Summary

**Problem**: Show artwork appeared blank in iOS lockscreen/notification tray when app first starts, then "popped in" later.

**Root Cause**: Race condition - lockscreen metadata was set BEFORE artwork finished downloading.

**Solution**: Download artwork FIRST (with 3-second timeout), then set lockscreen metadata with image included.

**Result**: Lockscreen shows complete metadata with artwork in one atomic update. No blank period, no visual "pop".

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### Modified Files:
- ✅ `/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` - Core iOS metadata handling

### Changes Made:
1. **New Method**: `downloadArtworkWithTimeout()` - Ensures 3-second max wait
2. **Refactored**: `applyPendingMetadataUpdate()` - Download-first pattern
3. **Refactored**: `handleUpdateNowPlaying()` - Same fix for alternative channel

### Lines Changed:
- Added: ~50 lines (new timeout method)
- Modified: ~80 lines (refactored update methods)
- Total: ~130 lines changed

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites:
- Physical iOS device (lockscreen behavior differs from simulator)
- Good network connection for initial tests
- Ability to throttle network for edge case testing

### Test Suite:

#### ✅ Test 1: Fresh App Start (Primary Test)
```
1. Force quit the app completely
2. Launch app
3. Press play button
4. Lock device immediately
5. EXPECTED: Lockscreen shows artwork within 3 seconds
6. VERIFY: No blank artwork period visible
```

#### ✅ Test 2: Cached Artwork (Performance Test)
```
1. App playing with show A
2. Note the show artwork
3. Pause for 5 seconds
4. Press play again
5. Lock device
6. EXPECTED: Artwork appears instantly (< 50ms)
7. VERIFY: No re-download (check Xcode logs)
```

#### ✅ Test 3: Show Change (Metadata Update Test)
```
1. App playing during show A
2. Wait for show B to start (check schedule)
3. Lock device when metadata updates
4. EXPECTED: New artwork appears within 3 seconds
5. VERIFY: Smooth transition, no flicker
```

#### ✅ Test 4: Slow Network (Timeout Test)
```
1. Enable Settings → Developer → Network Link Conditioner
2. Select "Very Bad Network" or "3G"
3. Launch app and press play
4. Lock device
5. EXPECTED: Lockscreen shows text within 3 seconds
6. VERIFY: Graceful fallback (text-only if artwork fails)
```

#### ✅ Test 5: Network Failure (Error Handling Test)
```
1. Enable Airplane Mode
2. Launch app (will use cached metadata)
3. Press play (will fail, but that's OK)
4. Disable Airplane Mode
5. Press play again
6. Lock device
7. EXPECTED: Artwork appears within 3 seconds
8. VERIFY: No crash, graceful recovery
```

#### ✅ Test 6: Background/Foreground (Persistence Test)
```
1. App playing with artwork visible
2. Lock device (verify artwork shows)
3. Unlock device
4. Background app (home button)
5. Wait 30 seconds
6. Return to app
7. Lock device again
8. EXPECTED: Artwork still visible
9. VERIFY: No re-download needed
```

### Monitoring Logs

Enable Xcode console and watch for these log patterns:

**✅ Success (Cached)**:
```
[METADATA] ✅ Using cached artwork for same URL: https://...
[METADATA] ✅ Lockscreen metadata set with artwork: true
```

**✅ Success (New Download)**:
```
[METADATA] 🎨 New artwork URL detected: 'https://...'
[METADATA] ⏳ Downloading artwork BEFORE setting lockscreen metadata...
[METADATA] 🔄 Artwork download attempt 1/3 for: https://...
[METADATA] ✅ Artwork downloaded successfully, size: (300.0, 300.0)
[METADATA] ✅ Lockscreen metadata set with artwork: true
```

**⚠️ Timeout (Acceptable)**:
```
[METADATA] ⏱️ Artwork download timeout (3.0s) - proceeding without image
[METADATA] ⚠️ Artwork download failed or timed out - setting metadata without image
[METADATA] ✅ Lockscreen metadata set with artwork: false
```

**❌ Error (Investigate)**:
```
[METADATA] ❌ Invalid URL for artwork: '...'
[METADATA] ❌ Failed to create UIImage from ... bytes
```

## 📊 Expected Performance

### Metrics:

| Scenario | Target | Acceptable | Investigate If |
|----------|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Cached artwork display** | < 50ms | < 100ms | > 200ms |
| **New artwork (good network)** | 0.5-1.5s | < 3s | > 3s |
| **Timeout rate** | < 2% | < 5% | > 10% |
| **Cache hit rate** | > 80% | > 70% | < 60% |

### User Experience:

✅ **Success Criteria**:
- No visible blank artwork period

- Artwork appears within 3 seconds
- Cached artwork is instant
- No crashes or hangs

❌ **Failure Indicators**:

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Artwork still shows blank

**Check**:
1. Is artwork URL valid? (Check logs)
2. Is network connection working?
3. Is timeout triggering? (Check for ⏱️ in logs)
4. Is artwork URL actually changing?

**Solution**:
- Verify metadata service returns valid `sh_photo` URL
- Test with different network conditions
- Check if timeout is too aggressive (increase if needed)

### Issue: Artwork downloads every time (no cache)

**Check**:
1. Are artwork URLs identical? (Check logs for URL comparison)
2. Is `lastArtworkUrl` being set correctly?
3. Is `cachedArtwork` being cleared unexpectedly?

**Solution**:
- Add more logging to cache path
- Verify URL string comparison is working
- Check for memory warnings clearing cache

### Issue: App crashes when locking device

**Check**:
1. Stack trace in crash report
2. Memory usage before crash
3. Thread safety issues

**Solution**:
- Verify all UI updates are on main thread
- Check for retain cycles in closures
- Review memory management in artwork download

### Issue: Timeout triggers too often

**Check**:
1. Network conditions
2. Artwork file sizes
3. Server response times

**Solution**:
- Consider increasing timeout from 3s to 5s
- Optimize artwork file sizes on server
- Add progressive loading (future enhancement)

### Debugging Commands:
```bash
# View iOS logs in real-time
xcrun simctl spawn booted log stream --predicate 'processImagePath contains "Runner"' --level debug

# Check network activity
# Settings → Developer → Network Link Conditioner

# Monitor memory usage
# Xcode → Debug → Memory Graph
```

### Common Questions:

**Q: Why 3 seconds for timeout?**
A: Balance between waiting for artwork and user experience. Most images download in < 1s on good connection. 3s is acceptable wait, prevents indefinite waiting.

**Q: Why not show placeholder image?**
A: Adds visual complexity and still shows a "change" when real artwork loads. Better to wait briefly for real artwork or show text-only.

**Q: Will this increase data usage?**
A: No - caching actually reduces usage. Same show artwork is downloaded once, then cached for all subsequent updates.

**Q: What about Android?**
A: This fix is iOS-specific. Android uses different metadata system (just_audio_background) which doesn't have this race condition.

**Q: Can we pre-load next show artwork?**
A: Yes, that's a future enhancement. Would require fetching schedule data and downloading artwork in background.
