  - Play/Pause control labeled and operable with screen readers (TalkBack/VoiceOver).
  - Live announcements for playback transitions (Loading, Buffering, Playing, Paused) and error states.
  - Loading spinner marked as a live region so "Loading audio" is read without moving focus.

### Resolved: iOS Lockscreen Metadata
- Resolved: Stable lockscreen metadata and working remote controls on iOS.
- Fix summary: Implemented native `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` updates via platform channel, debounced updates to avoid churn, and wired `MPRemoteCommandCenter` handlers to Flutter (play/pause/toggle) so taps control the `WPFWAudioHandler`.
- Verification: VoiceOver reads current show/song on lockscreen; controls operate playback reliably without flicker.
- Documentation: [Comprehensive history and approach](docs/iOS_LOCKSCREEN_COMPREHENSIVE.md), [Fix approach](docs/LOCKSCREEN_METADATA_FIX_APPROACH.md), and [Master notes](docs/iOS_LOCKSCREEN_METADATA_MASTER.md)

## Architecture Overview

- **Framework**: Flutter (Dart)
- **State management**: `flutter_bloc` + `get_it` service locator
- **Audio playback**: `just_audio` with `audio_service` and `audio_session`
- **Networking**: `dio` and `http`
- **Storage/Device**: `shared_preferences`, `path_provider`, `device_info_plus`
- **Web content**: `flutter_inappwebview`
- **UI**: Material 3 theme, Google Fonts, SVG, cached images

High-level flow:
- `HomePage` (`lib/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`) renders the main experience: station artwork, metadata, and a single large play/pause control that dispatches events to `StreamBloc`.
- `StreamBloc` (`lib/presentation/bloc/stream_bloc.dart`) orchestrates playback via `StreamRepository` (`lib/data/repositories/stream_repository.dart`).
- `WPFWAudioHandler` (`lib/services/audio_service/wpfw_audio_handler.dart`) wraps `just_audio` and integrates with `audio_service` for background/notification control.
- Metadata services (`lib/services/metadata_service*.dart`) fetch and adapt current/next show info and song data to the UI and, eventually, the iOS lockscreen.
- Platform integration for iOS lockscreen is under active development using native `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` and `MPRemoteCommandCenter` via platform channels (see docs below).

## Setup & Build

Prereqs:
- Flutter SDK (stable) and platform toolchains (Xcode for iOS, Android SDK/NDK for Android)

Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

Run (Android):
```bash
flutter run -d android
```

Run (iOS Simulator):
```bash
flutter run -d ios
```

Build:
```bash
flutter build apk   # Android
flutter build ios   # iOS (requires Xcode signing)
```

## Usage

- Open the app to the main `HomePage`.
- Tap the large play/pause button to start/stop the WPFW stream.
- Bottom-right Alarm button opens the Sleep Timer overlay.
- Bottom-left Donate button opens the in-app Donate modal WebView; external links open in the system browser.
- Tap the top-right icon to open the Pacifica Apps & Services grid.

## Accessibility

Basic screen reader support (Sep 5, 2025):
- Dynamic labels/hints for the play/pause control.
- Announcements for playback transitions (Loading, Buffering, Playing, Paused) and errors.
- Donate modal: labeled close button; announcements for page load and external browser opening.

Planned next steps (non-visual): focus traps in modals, `MergeSemantics` for metadata blocks, contrast/tap-target audits, and dev-only a11y tooling. See: [accessibity.md](../accessibity.md).

## Platform specifics: iOS lockscreen metadata

- Background: iOS lockscreen metadata currently exhibits refresh/flicker and "Not Playing" alternation in some states.
- Approach: Implement native `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` updates and `MPRemoteCommandCenter` handlers via platform channels from Flutter to Swift.
- Status: Documented; platform channel and native integration in progress.
- Docs:
  - `docs/iOS_LOCKSCREEN_METADATA_MASTER.md`
  - `docs/LOCKSCREEN_METADATA_FIX_APPROACH.md`
  - `docs/archive/iOS_LOCKSCREEN_COMPREHENSIVE.md`
  - Related issue notes: `docs/ANDROID_LOCKSCREEN_CONTROLS_ISSUE.md`

## Troubleshooting

- Stream fails to start or frequently buffers
  - Check connectivity; see `connectivity_plus` status and retry from Snackbar.
  - Review logs via `LoggerService` in `lib/core/services/logger_service.dart`.

- iOS lockscreen shows stale or no metadata
  - Confirm native integration is on the correct branch and platform channels are wired.
  - Refer to the iOS lockscreen docs (above) for current status and test steps.

- WebView links not opening externally
  - Ensure `url_launcher` is properly configured for iOS/Android.
  - In Donate modal, unsupported schemes are handed off to the system browser.

## Roadmap / Backlog

- Finalize iOS lockscreen native channel for stable metadata and working remote commands.
- Add focus management and semantics grouping for overlays/modals.
- Introduce CI a11y checks (e.g., `accessibility_lint`) and basic widget tests for semantics.
- Improve contrast and typography in dark theme as needed (AA level).
- Explore replacing/augmenting playback with `radio_player` or a native iOS `AVPlayer` integration if warranted by lockscreen constraints.
